# 🧠 2. Brainstorm (lg-brainstormer)

Now that the project is initialized, let's think about the "Wow-Factor".

## Goals
- **Visual Impact**: How will this look across multiple screens?
- **AI Integration**: What agentic features will you use? (e.g., voice control, automated KML generation).
- **Architecture**: How will you structure your providers and services?

## Checklist
- [ ] Define the primary use case (e.g., Tour Guide, Data Viz).
- [ ] Map out the UI flow.
- [ ] Identify which Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A Liquid Galaxy app is about immersion. Think BIG (literally, across all screens).
