# 📝 3. Plan (lg-plan-writer)

Turn your ideas into a concrete implementation plan.

## Requirements
1. **Service Layer**: Outline the SSH and Gemini service methods.
2. **State Management**: Choose between `provider`, `bloc`, or `riverpod`. (Recommendation: `provider` for simplicity in this kit).
3. **UI Layout**: Design a drawer or side menu for LG controls.

## Educational Checkpoint
- Why use SSH for Liquid Galaxy?
- How does KML synchronization work across screens?

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `implementation_plan.md` artifact to document your decisions.
