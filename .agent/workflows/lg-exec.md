# 🛠️ 4. Execute (lg-exec)

Time to write some code!

## Batches
1. **Core Utilities**: SSH connection logic and KML templates.
2. **AI Layer**: Gemini API integration and prompt engineering.
3. **UI Implementation**: Building beautiful, responsive screens.
4. **Integration**: Connecting the UI to the services.

## Verification
- Run `flutter analyze` often.
- Test SSH commands in isolation before integrating with the UI.

// turbo
flutter analyze
